Different DataSet Analysis

Welcome to my Machine Learning project repository! This repo contains beginner-to-intermediate level end-to-end projects using **real-world datasets** to apply core ML concepts like data cleaning, EDA, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📊 Projects Included

1) ***SUV sales analysis***
   
   **Goal**: Predict whether a user is likely to purchase an SUV based on demographic features like age, salary, and gender.
   **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
   **Highlights**:
       -Train-Test split and model training using LogisticRegression
      -Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report    
      -Visualization of decision boundary using Matplotlib
   **DataSet Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamaniket/suv-data

2) ***Student Social media Addiction analysis:***
   
  **Goal**: To predict how social media habits (platforms, frequency, etc.) influence students' academic performance based on self-reported data.
  **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
  **Highlights**:
    - One-Hot Encoding of categorical features
    - Evaluation using R², RMSE, MAE
    - Actual vs Predicted scatter plot
**DataSet Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/social-media-addiction-vs-relationships

3) ***Titanic Data Analysis:***
   
  **Goal**: This project explores the famous **Titanic dataset** to identify patterns and insights into passenger survival. 
  **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
  **Highlights**:
  - Data cleaning, Handling missing values
  - Key Insights using Visualisation
  - Survival Analysis

4) ***Telecom Customer Data:***

  **Goal**: This project analyzes telecom customer data to predict churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave the service provider). Using logistic regression, we build a simple but effective classification model   after preprocessing and scaling the data.
  **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
  **Highlights**:
    - Data Preprocessing
    - One-Hot Encoding of categorical features
    - Evaluation using Accuracy,Precision,Recall,F1 score
    - Confusion Matrix
**DataSet Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

5) ***Insurance Charges Prediction (Linear vs Ridge vs Lasso Regression)***
   
  **Goal**:To predict medical insurance charges based on personal attributes like age, BMI, region, smoking habits, and more.
  **Algorithm**:Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression
  **Highlights**:
    -Data scaling using StandardScaler before applying Ridge/Lasso
     -Actual vs Predicted scatter plot comparison for all three models
**DataSet Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance
