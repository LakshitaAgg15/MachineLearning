Different DataSet Analysis

Welcome to my Machine Learning project repository! This repo contains beginner-to-intermediate level end-to-end projects using **real-world datasets** to apply core ML concepts like data cleaning, EDA, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## üìä Projects Included

1) SUV sales analysis
   **Goal**: Predict whether a user is likely to purchase an SUV based on demographic features like age, salary, and gender.
   **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
   **Highlights**:
    -Train-Test split and model training using LogisticRegression
    -Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report    
    -Visualization of decision boundary using Matplotlib
   **DataSet Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamaniket/suv-data

3) Student Social media Addiction analysis:
  **Goal**: To predict how social media habits (platforms, frequency, etc.) influence students' academic performance based on self-reported data.
  **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
  **Highlights**:
  - One-Hot Encoding of categorical features
  - Evaluation using R¬≤, RMSE, MAE
  - Actual vs Predicted scatter plot
**DataSet Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/social-media-addiction-vs-relationships
