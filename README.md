Different DataSet Analysis

Welcome to my Machine Learning project repository! This repo contains beginner-to-intermediate level end-to-end projects using **real-world datasets** to apply core ML concepts like data cleaning, EDA, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## üìä Projects Included

1) ***SUV sales analysis***
   
   **Goal**: Predict whether a user is likely to purchase an SUV based on demographic features like age, salary, and gender.
   
   **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
   
   **Highlights**:
       -Train-Test split and model training using LogisticRegression
   
      -Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report
      
      -Visualization of decision boundary using Matplotlib

2) ***Student Social media Addiction analysis:***
   
  **Goal**: To predict how social media habits (platforms, frequency, etc.) influence students' academic performance based on self-reported data.
  
  **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
  
  **Highlights**:
  
    - One-Hot Encoding of categorical features
    
    - Evaluation using R¬≤, RMSE, MAE
    
    - Actual vs Predicted scatter plot

3) ***Titanic Data Analysis:***
   
  **Goal**: This project explores the famous **Titanic dataset** to identify patterns and insights into passenger survival. 
  
  **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
  
  **Highlights**:
  
  - Data cleaning, Handling missing values
  
  - Key Insights using Visualisation

4) ***Telecom Customer Data:***

 **Goal**: This project analyzes telecom customer data to predict churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave the service provider). Using logistic regression, we build a simple but effective classification model   after preprocessing and scaling the data.

  **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
  
  **Highlights**:
  
    - Data Preprocessing
    
    - One-Hot Encoding of categorical features
    
    - Evaluation using Accuracy,Precision,Recall,F1 score
    
    - Confusion Matrix

5) ***Insurance Charges Prediction (Linear vs Ridge vs Lasso Regression)***
   
  **Goal**:To predict medical insurance charges based on personal attributes like age, BMI, region, smoking habits, and more.
  
  **Algorithm**:Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression
  
  **Highlights**:
  
    -Data scaling using StandardScaler before applying Ridge/Lasso
    
     -Actual vs Predicted scatter plot comparison for all three models

6) ***Loan Approval Prediction (Logistic vs SVM vs KNN vs Random Forest)***
   
  **Goal**:To predict whether a loan will be approved based on applicant information such as gender, marital status, income, education, employment status, and property area..
  
  **Algorithm**:Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest
  
  **Highlights**:
  
      -Missing value imputation using mode (for categorical) and median (for numerical)

      -Label Encoding for categorical variables
      
      -Trained and compared four classification models
      
      -Achieved best accuracy of 81% using Random Forest
      
      -Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
